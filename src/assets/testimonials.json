I had been dealing with thoughts of pain and hurt from the rejection I felt from from a loved one who was recently deceased.</p>\n<p>Those thoughts have been replaced with love and acceptance for myself, and forgiveness for my loved one. And in the absence of that dark / stuck energy, it almost seems like a vacuum has been created and more light and love than I’ve felt in a long time seems to be suddenly flowing into my life. It’s quite beautiful!\t\t</p>\n",

A few months ago, I would say more than a year ago; I visited Gedalia&#8217;s office looking for help as I was trying to find myself again. I did not make a mistake when I requested her assistance, she gave me so many healthy tips and valuable information on how to care for myself, through nutrition, meditation, and Marma sessions. Gedalia&#8217;s knowledge of Ayurveda and her natural healing gift sets her apart from other professionals that I have seen in the past. She teaches you how to properly eat and some other rituals you need to implement in your life for a healthier you. She recently wrote a book: &#8220;Enough Drugs! I am a Woman and Can Heal Naturally&#8221; I cannot thank her enough because in her book she provides all kind of advice that benefits us and makes us better, physically and spiritually. Hope you have the opportunity to read the book and experience Marma therapy, believe me, it works if you are ready and keep an open mind and heart. &#8220;May you always trust yourself and your ability to grow and to bloom no matter what odds are against you&#8221;\t\t</p>\n",

I found that my physical and psychological health gradually returned to a much healthier state, and well as experiencing a heart-opening, one that has infused my life with a greater depth of gratitude and appreciation for all life. I would highly recommend this approach to those who are seeking some relief and healing.\t\t</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>\t\t\t\tI recently had a series of three MARMA treatments from Gedalia Genin. She explained to me that each person gets benefits that are unique to them and their needs. I was interested to see what that would mean for me.</p>\n<p>My treatments resulted in a profound detox effect. I had been injured multiple times in my life, and then 24 years ago I sustained a catastrophic injury. Since that time I have been fortunate enough to receive lots of medical care which has kept me alive while I did the work to try to recover. As lucky as I am to have had all the drugs and treatments, it was inevitable that they left a very heavy toxic hangover in my body.</p>\n<p>I have tried many detox methods, but the MARMA treatments delivered in a profound way. My body seemed to be suddenly able to LET GO of massive amounts of toxic substances. My body seemed to be self-cleansing. In every way that a body can excrete toxic elements, mine did. I experienced some detox symptoms, but they were mild. At this point, I feel very clean and light inside and out.</p>\n<p>I would highly recommend these treatments to anyone that has been through profound drug treatment, like chemo. or massive drug therapies for uncontrollable pain like I have gone through, or anything that where many substances have been administered into your body or you just feel heavy and overwhelmed. The detox effect was not only physically cleansing but also resulted in a mental and spiritual lightening effect. I feel lighter, more fluid and more open, and I seem to be more resilient.</p>\n<p>I am truly grateful to Gedalia her gifts and spa staff for creating such a healing environment. I wish you profound benefits from your MARMA experiences. Thank you.\t\t</p>\n",
