A few months ago, I would say more than a year ago; I visited Gedalia&#8217;s office looking for help as I was trying to find myself again. I did not make a mistake when I requested her assistance, she gave me so many healthy tips and valuable information on how to care for myself, through nutrition, meditation, and Marma sessions. Gedalia&#8217;s knowledge of Ayurveda and her natural healing gift sets her apart from other professionals that I have seen in the past. She teaches you how to properly eat and some other rituals you need to implement in your life for a healthier you. She recently wrote a book: &#8220;Enough Drugs! I am a Woman and Can Heal Naturally&#8221; I cannot thank her enough because in her book she provides all kind of advice that benefits us and makes us better, physically and spiritually. Hope you have the opportunity to read the book and experience Marma therapy, believe me, it works if you are ready and keep an open mind and heart. &#8220;May you always trust yourself and your ability to grow and to bloom no matter what odds are against you&#8221;</p>\n",

I was interested to see what that would mean for me.</p>\n<p>My treatments resulted in a profound detox effect. I had been injured multiple times in my life, and then 24 years ago I sustained a catastrophic injury. Since that time I have been fortunate enough to receive lots of medical care which has kept me alive while I did the work to try to recover. As lucky as I am to have had all the drugs and treatments, it was inevitable that they left a very heavy toxic hangover in my body.</p>\n<p>I have tried many detox methods, but the MARMA treatments delivered in a profound way. My body seemed to be suddenly able to LET GO of massive amounts of toxic substances. My body seemed to be self-cleansing. In every way that a body can excrete toxic elements, mine did. I experienced some detox symptoms, but they were mild. At this point, I feel very clean and light inside and out.</p>\n<p>I would highly recommend these treatments to anyone that has been through profound drug treatment, like chemo. or massive drug therapies for uncontrollable pain like I have gone through, or anything that where many substances have been administered into your body or you just feel heavy and overwhelmed. The detox effect was not only physically cleansing but also resulted in a mental and spiritual lightening effect. I feel lighter, more fluid and more open, and I seem to be more resilient.</p>\n<p>I am truly grateful to Gedalia her gifts and spa staff for creating such a healing environment. I wish you profound benefits from your MARMA experiences. Thank you.</p>\n",

I went into the appointment not really sure what to expect, but with an open mind and spirit. I very quickly felt relaxation washing over me. Then when you put the crystals on me and left the room, I was transported – not like a hallucination or a dream or a forced thought – but by gentle puffs of sensations and images that wafted around me. I felt like I was in some ancient marble outdoor temple. There were waterfalls and sunlight. I was surrounded by three or four goddess-like women with long flowing hair, long flowing dresses, and bracelets that made little musical noises when they moved. I felt like they were there with me because of their pure love for nurturing people – their happiness, beauty, and light came from taking care of me. I felt like they were as comforting as a mother and as bonded as sisters could be to me. I was filled with a sense of being loved, nurtured, safe, happy, and healthy. That feeling has floated in and around me since our session together. Thank you so much for that!</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Having studied some Ayurveda and incorporated elements into my daily routine, I was particularly interested to try Marma Therapy. After being rear-ended and struggling to work through some of the mental trauma, I decided to see if Marma therapy could help me to find balance again and move forward from the emotional numbness that I was feeling. Gedalia has a wonderful sense of calm and reassurance about her, which was very nourishing and allowed me to open up. I came out of my first session with an energy and lightness that I hadn&#8217;t felt in a while, having experienced a profound sense of relaxation, but also a heightened sense of self and beyond. My breath was easy and unlabored as if a weight of emotion had been physically lifted. In subsequent sessions, I have felt my energy balance further to a point that I feel calm, but energized at the same time, and as though excess heat or cold has been able to re-distribute to a point of beneficial temperature regulation. I feel like I am able to get in touch with a spiritual side of myself that has been held back until now. The sessions have been invaluable.</p>\n",
