Pressured with goals for the New Year including weight loss, perhaps a change of career, passing an important test exam, an overdue divorce, a move , a creative endeavor, or the care taking of an elderly parent,your mind becomes overwhelmed. Holiday shopping is in full bloom, politics is on fire , (along with the real fires in California), your social media time has increased, your sleep reduced, and the parties have just begun. Whew, we are all busy!</p>\n<p>How do you find happiness amidst all this? Shouldn&#8217;t this season be joyous? festive? happy? How do I feel happy with so much to do?</p>\n<p><em><strong>The three major blocks to happiness are:</strong></em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>You got the first one- <em><strong>living in the past or in the future</strong></em>. Accepting &#8220;what is&#8221; brings us into the now. Eckhart Tolle in his book &#8220;Power of Now&#8221; describes this well.\n<div class=\"mod\" data-md=\"50\" data-hveid=\"CAkQAA\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjsuvDIpIrfAhWurFkKHRbtC0YQkCkwHHoECAkQAA\">\n<div class=\"hb8SAc kno-fb-ctx\" data-hveid=\"CAkQAQ\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjsuvDIpIrfAhWurFkKHRbtC0YQziAoADAcegQICRAB\">\n<div class=\"r-iOuZAMglR2rI\">\n<div class=\"kno-rdesc r-iZ4juDZVMBIM\" data-rtid=\"iZ4juDZVMBIM\">\n<div><span>The book is intended to be a guide for day-to-day living and stresses the importance of living in the present moment and avoiding thoughts of the past or future.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>Self acceptance and acceptance of &#8221; what is&#8221; brings our attention to the essence of our being ( whether we judge it or not) that then leads to inner calm and freedom. Seeing something in it&#8217;s true light means acceptance and that includes us- our bodies as they are, etc. etc. etc&#8230; (you may fill in the blanks.)</div>\n<div><em><strong>So for NOW I invite you to take a deep breath and Pause. You may ask yourself, what can I accept today that can reduce my suffering and anxiety? Acknowledge it and feel compassion as if your best friend just told you this story. Accept it into your being. Offer it to nature, or a body of water or to fire.</strong></em></div>\n<div>2. I&#8217;ve already clued you on the next one- <em><strong>comparison. Ah, you look at social media and someone else looks more glamorous, has a gorgeous partner, or appears to be living the perfect life.</strong></em> Social media can get one thinking this way.&nbsp;<em><b>Reflecting inwardly on your innate gifts is probably not something we do enough of. Thanking ourselves, loving&nbsp;ourselves, even though&#8230;&#8230; we have limitations is the antidote to comparison.</b></em></div>\n</div>\n<div><em><strong>Just for today, take five minutes in silence and thank yourself for things you like about yourself. See how that feels. Are you smiling? Do you have good things to say about yourself? Are you feeling shy? Jot them down in a notebook or journal to look at when you&#8217;ve forgotten to love yourself.</strong></em></div>\n<div>3.When I retire, I will&#8230;. When I lose weight, I will&#8230;. When I get the right partner&#8230;&#8230; when I pay off my debt, I will&#8230;.when I get a face lift, I will&#8230;.</div>\n<div>The third enemy, postponement. What did you postpone this year?&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the reasons we may postpone something could be connected to self doubt. &#8221; Someone else knows how to speak in public better than I can or on facebook or instagram&#8221;- &#8221; I look too old to speak on the computer camera&#8221;..&#8221; I started so many diets and failed&#8221; .</div>\n<div>The antidote-<em><strong> accountability and short term commitments.</strong>&nbsp;For example,</em>I will walk three days this week. I will post one new Facebook live this week. Whatever you&#8217;ve been postponing&nbsp; aim to break it down in smaller&nbsp; steps.</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><em><strong>As the next few weeks bring a close to the year 2018, here are three things that could <span style=\"color: #339966;\">increase&nbsp;</span> your happiness:</strong></em></span></div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>&nbsp;Spending a few minutes or even seconds each day focusing on your breath, being aware of your body, and entering a state of mental calmness has been linked to a wide variety of physical and emotional benefits.</strong></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Exercise. 30 minutes of exercise, cardio, or yoga releases a surge of endorphins through your body, thus improving your mood and decreasing your stress levels.</strong></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Spend time outside.

I would imagine that everyone is or has been experiencing some digestive murmurs from the big turkey dinner festivity and coming up is Hannukah and Christmas. No doubt we might be eating more food than usual or indulging in foods we regularly don&#8217;t eat. For me, it&#8217;s been that wonderful hot chocolate with whipped cream I save for this time of year and some fried potato pancakes, a staple ofÂ  the Hannukah tradition coming up. Thanksgiving stays under control for the most part for me. Although I did try a shot of caramel shnops at the end which was way good.</p>\n<p>But nevertheless, it&#8217;s cold, we are probably eating more mac and cheese than last season, or extra fats to keep us warm. All good. This is natural in winter.Â  Since you know I like to come from a nurturing place, not denial, I am sharing with you One GREAT Holiday Self Care Practice-Â <em><strong>Ayurveda&#8217;s Digestive Tea.Â </strong> </em></p>\n<p><em>As you can see from the picture I already got a head start- please join me in this daily ritual and let&#8217;s think of each other as we sip our tea!

The mind is the 6th sense in Ayurveda. It &#8216;senses&#8217; the sense organs, and interprets their experiences. Ayurveda places great importance on improving the acumen and strength of the five senses. What if your taste was stronger, your eyes keener, your ears more sensitive? You would have a higher perception of reality. Your sense organs are truly your only means of contact with the outside world. <em><strong>Your sense organs are the best tools you have to keep your body healthy,</strong> </em>including selecting the right foods, wearing seasonally appropriate clothing, and even interacting with your community. Here are some simple ways you can strengthen your senses:</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sense Organ</th>\n<th>How to Strengthen</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tongue</td>\n<td>Fast, incorporate bitter taste in the diet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nose</td>\n<td>Exhale, breathe fresh air, oil nasal passages</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Eyes</td>\n<td>Add alteratives, pitta pacifying herbs, and amalaki to your routine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ears</td>\n<td>Be in a quiet space, clear out wax</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Touch</td>\n<td>Stay clean, add massage and dry brushing to your routine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mind</td>\n<td>Meditate, practice deep breathing, rest</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dr. Deepak Chopra shares thatÂ  according to <span>Ayurveda, sensory impressions are considered crucial to health. Just as the food we eat creates our bodily tissues, our sensory impressions determine the quality of our thoughts and emotions. <em><strong>If we aspire greater physical and emotional well-being, we can use sounds, feelings, sights, tastes, and smells to balance and heal our selves.Â </strong></em></span></p>\n<p>It is for this reason that I created the <em><strong>&#8221; inner home , outer home visit&#8221;.Â  It includes tips on balancing the five senses for your inner and outer home- your body/mind and the space in which you live &#8211; from essential oils to colors, gemstones, direction of sleep and more.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>This unique in home visit balances body and mind during the first hour with Marma Therapy and for the second hour I will assist you in creating balance and harmony in the home or space you are living in- creating a sacred space perhaps? where is the best place for meditation in my home? What colors should I use in my living space?or bedroom? How do I meditate? what yoga postures can help bring me into balance? How can i breathe more fully? Which tastes will bring balance to my body and mind?</strong></em></p>\n<p>No traffic, no stress, no mess.</p>\n<p>For more information visitÂ <a href=\"http:/gedaliahealingarts.com\">http:/gedaliahealingarts.com</a>/servicesÂ  Tuesdya&#8217;s at Dr. Bindiya with Revive Atlanta MD DecaturÂ  call 678-357-3443 for appts.</p>\n<p>Visit my colorful art for a visual lift atÂ <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/GedaliaHealingArts?ref=search_shop_redirect\">https://www.etsy.com/shop/GedaliaHealingArts?ref=search_shop_redirect</a></p>\n<p>I look forward to seeing you soon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>with fierce love,</p>\n<p>Gedalia</p>\n",

For those who know me, my love for essential oils is eternal! I&#8217;ve used them both personally and professionally for over 30 years and am still amazed at their miraculous ability to support the mind, body, and emotions. Our sense of smell activates the &#8220;limbic&#8221; part of the brain which regulates hormones and emotions. I enjoy keeping my diffuser in the kitchen while I cook to inhale the benefits. A cool mist diffuser is preferred over heat to maintain the integrity of the oils. This is an exampleÂ Â <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/VicTsing-Humidifier-Ultrasonic-Essential-Diffuser/dp/B07GQP3YWR/ref=zg_bs_16250381_4?_encoding=UTF8&amp;refRID=EW60JM43K047MX7QH77S\">https://www.amazon.com/VicTsing-Humidifier-Ultrasonic-Essential-Diffuser/dp/B07GQP3YWR/ref=zg_bs_16250381_4?_encoding=UTF8&amp;refRID=EW60JM43K047MX7QH77S</a></p>\n<p><span>Â <em><strong>The goal of Ayurveda is to create balance and harmony to prevent disease.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p>Each season of the yearÂ  I hand make an essential oilÂ roll-on.

These qualities can affect the body and mind with restless sleep, anxiety, and fatigue. This roll on is made with ingredientsÂ such as vanilla, jasmine, holy basil and vetiver in a fractionated blend to decrease anxiety, fatigue and depression.

As the leaves change color and fall from the trees there </span></em>is<em><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> dryness, wind and cool qualities of the earth. These qualities stimulate &#8220;</span></em>vata<em><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&#8221; both in the environment and within our bodies and mind.Â </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A</span></em> homeopathic principle also true in Ayurveda is that &#8221; like increases like&#8221; and &#8220;opposite qualitiesÂ heal&#8221;. With that said the opposite of dryness in terms of diet is</p>\n<p><em><strong>warm, cooked and oily</strong></em>. This may be difficult if you&#8217;re used to having cold smoothies from the summer but it is actually a good time to make a shift.</p>\n<p>Nature is giving us warm, sweet nurturing foods such as butternut squash, pumpkin, apples, pears supporting our immune system for winter. If you follow nature you follow Ayurveda. How could you go wrong with that?</p>\n<p>You may want to replace your morning smoothie with cooked apples, dates and ghee, and steel cut oats for example. Instead of saladÂ for lunch, you might have a lentil vegetable soup,Â butternut squash soup,Â kitchariÂ or wild salmon cooked with vegetables. If your not a cook and want to pick up kitchariÂ you can find Ayurvedic meals in Buckhead atÂ <a href=\"http://samafoodforbalance.com/\">http://samafoodforbalance.com/</a></p>\n<p>The windy qualityÂ can often stir a bout of constipation or dry skin. <em><strong>Dry foods such as pea protein, chips, leftovers, microwaved, popcorn, crackers increase the dry qualityÂ in our bodies which again is not the goal for this season.</strong></em></p>\n<p>To counteract use plenty of ghee ( hold the coconut oil as it&#8217;s cooling), olive oil, and oil the skin with sesame oil daily. This ancient practice of abhyanga is both anti-aging, immune supporting and hydrating for the skin. You can use sesame oil for this practice. For more info visitÂ <a href=\"https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/living-ayurveda/lifestyle/self-oil-massage/\">https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/living-ayurveda/lifestyle/self-oil-massage/</a></p>\n<p>Once you get into the habit of oiling your skin daily I guarantee you will love the results. It&#8217;s grounding, nurturing and gets a big check on the &#8220;self-care&#8221;&#8216;list.</p>\n<p>Be sure to stay well hydrated and if you find your emotions have gotten stirred up spend time breathing, meditating and noting what no longer serves you. Minimize the negative effects of the news and replace it with something fun like dancing, writing a poem, baking or quilting. Aim to let it go or at best witness the emotions with compassion and self-love. It&#8217;s hardest to love our limitations but don&#8217;t you love everythingÂ about your children? Well if you don&#8217;t you at least give them acceptance and compassion.</p>\n<p>Be extra good to yourself this season and don&#8217;t forget to include a &#8220;Marma&#8221; session for your self-care. It&#8217;s anti-aging, grounding, enhances the flow of energy in your body/mind, clears negative energy, balances emotions and hormones, plus&#8230;.Â here is what the Chopra Center writes about itÂ Â <a href=\"https://chopra.com/search?keys=marma\">https://chopra.com/search?keys=marma</a></p>\n<p>For more testimonials about Marma go toÂ <a href=\"http://gedaliahealingarts.com/testimonials/\">http://gedaliahealingarts.com/testimonials/</a></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be in Decatur a few Tuesdays a month for appts.Â  Also offering in home visits for &#8220;new clients&#8221; ( not previously form other offices).Call 678-357-3443 or email me..

Nutritional risk factors can be found due to synthetic hormones used in the meat and dairy industry, chemical pesticides used in agriculture, chlorinated water, preservatives in packaged foods, birth control, hormone replacement, white sugar, aluminum products, soda containers and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Â  Â  Â  3. The suppression of grief, sadness, stress, feelings of isolation, lack of purpose, and the use of underwire bras are just some of the main contributors to imbalances in breast health.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>The following are twelve useful tips from Ayurveda on breast cancer prevention:Â </strong></em></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider taking iodine 3-mgs per day.Â  <em><strong>The best sources are from foods like kelp and sea vegetables.Â </strong></em>Â Kelp can be found at most health food stores. I like to put kelp or kombu in my soups while cooking and remove them when done. Iodine according to Ayurveda is a natural antiseptic for the blood warding off infection. The company &#8220;Standard Process&#8221; makes &#8220;Promaline Iodine&#8221; which is a good and safe source. It can be found on Amazon or at some chiropractic offices. This brand is not sold in health food stores. Sea vegetables and kelp can be added to the diet. To learn more about which seaweeds to use read this articleÂ <a href=\"https://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/15/which-seaweed-to-help-prevent-breast-cancer/\">https://nutritionfacts.org/2014/05/15/which-seaweed-to-help-prevent-breast-cancer/</a>Â Before taking iodineÂ please check with your doctor.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Â  Â  Â  Â  2.Â </span>Understand your unique mind/body type and cultivate a lifestyle that is appropriate for your needs- no two people are the same in Ayurveda. You may review Gedalia&#8217;s book &#8221; Enough Drugs! I Am A Woman And Can Heal Naturally- a practical guide to feeling your best&#8221; to learn more about Ayurveda and your unique body type.<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Enough-Drugs-Woman-Heal-Naturally/dp/0692811613\">https://www.amazon.com/Enough-Drugs-Woman-Heal-Naturally/dp/069281161</a></p>\n<p>3. Avoid underwire bras as they constrict lymphatic flow. The lymphatic system is a network of tissues and organs that help to remove waste from our bodies and some of the main channels are underneath the armpits and around the breast tissue. Sports bras are a good substitute for underwire bras as they provide both support and comfort.</p>\n<p>4.Â  It is a good idea while doing Ayurveda&#8217;s self-massage with oil to massage under the armpits and around the breasts. You may include the essential oil &#8220;orange&#8221; as you do this. Orange oil is an excellent detoxifier. You can add one or two drops to your sesame oil.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Â Â Â Â Â Â 5 . Exercise regularly â moderate exercise helps to balance hormones and cleanse the body of accumulated toxins. I am a big fan of walking.Â  Thirty minutes daily of walking briskly has tremendous health benefits.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Include foods like soups, Dahlâs, mustard greens, and ginger in your diet. They are cleansing and easy to digest.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Drink dandelion and fennel tea. Dandelion is known for it&#8217;s antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and liver detoxing properties. You can purchase dandelion tea at Whole Foods and other grocery stores.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Use the herb &#8220;Shatavari&#8221; which helps prevent toxic build up around the breasts. Shatavari is not recommended for anyone with cystic breasts. Check with an Ayurvedic practitioner before using herbs. Shatavari is a unique herb ( which comes from the asparagus plant). It helps to maintain the health of the female reproductive system from the start of the menstrual cycle to postmenopausal years. To read more about the benefits of Shatavari click hereÂ Â <a href=\"https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/living-ayurveda/herbs/shatavari/\">https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/living-ayurveda/herbs/shatavari/</a></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Â  Â  Â  Â 9. Take âtriphalaâ daily to help remove toxins. Triphala is made up of three fruits- nature&#8217;s natural and gentle colon cleanser. It is a natural antioxidant. To learn more click here</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/living-ayurveda/herbs/triphala/\">https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/living-ayurveda/herbs/triphala/</a>Â  Triphala comes in a tea or tablet form. Best taken at night.</p>\n<p>10. Avoid foods that create toxins in the body such as leftovers, frozen foods and canned foods</p>\n<p>11. Listen and intuitively connect with your body.Â  For example, notice when your body is full when eating. Stop there.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Â  Â  Â  Â  12. Lastly, include Marma Therapy in your health regimen to move stagnant energy and free the body of toxins.Â </span></p>\n<p>Remember, it&#8217;s the regular steps you take each day of self-care and self-love that are the ingredients of a holistic lifestyle.</p>\n<p>To learn more about my &#8221; in home whole health visits&#8221; ( which include Marma) go toÂ <a href=\"http://gedaliahealingarts.com/\">http://gedaliahealingarts.com/</a></p>\n<p>Hope to see you soon,</p>\n<p>with fierce love,</p>\n<p>Gedalia</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
